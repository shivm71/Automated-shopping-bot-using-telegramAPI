Created shopping bot which notify users when there is sudden drop in price or
abnormal discount via Price graph available for products using Python, Telethon
library, YAML, Asyncio & telegram APIs. Fetched data of 1 million active users from different groups & channels and dump
CSVs and employed custom scheduled bots for inviting users to join our channel
Used client rotation scheme to maximize throughput of sending messages @ of
30 / second to 200 / second by maintaining asynchronous connection with server
User can get personalized notifications for the categories they have chosen to sub- scribe by answering chat bot questions on their social as well as telegram handle
Worked with event listeners to send timely notifications by placing them on
different channels & groups and also keep track for information on other groups
